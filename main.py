    Solution to tetriling problem.

    The Tetris function was imported by performance testing code, which randomly 
    generated a target matrix, ran the solver then analysed the solution.

    In the assessment of the coursework the solver was tested with three different 
    targets of varying size and density.

            - Solution is then flipped back, and the shapeIDs are corrected with their flipped equivalents.
            - The new solution is then ran through saveSolution method, choosing the new best solution

            Due to the nature of the problem sometimes the best piece in terms of scoring is not the best solution. 
            For large problems this averages out but for small matrixes this creates a large inconsistancy in the accuracy score.
            Therefore a way to run the same problem multiple times producing different solutions with the same method was needed:
            Randomising which piece was picked for fitPiece2 was likely to reduce accuracy.
            Reordering the tree on the fly for fitPiece, without having multiple trees, is very hard.
            Method needed to use existing solving methods without repeating them.
